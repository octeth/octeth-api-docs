# Server Initialization

Initialize a virtual machine (VM) with your preferred hosting provider. For this guide, we'll use specifications suitable for running Octeth:

- 4 Intel/AMD vCPUs
- 8 GB RAM
- 80 GB SSD
- Operating System: Ubuntu 24.04
- Networking: Public IPv4 and Public IPv6
- SSH Keys: Add your SSH key for secure access
- Server Name: octeth-server

For this example, assume your hosting provider assigned `203.0.113.10` as the public IP address.
